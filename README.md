Football fans know a lot of newsworthy events and stories happen every day, even more so during the season and around playoffs. Most casual fans and even some avid fans don't always have enough time to read through all the articles written every day. To help readers who want to stay up on the latest news and stories about the people and events they care about, I have decided to build an article recommender.
